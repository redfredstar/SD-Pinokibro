# CAPTAINS_LOG.md - The Live Handover & Changelog

## **PREAMBLE: THE PROJECT'S MEMORY**

This document is the single source of truth for the **momentum, context, and history** of the PinokioCloud Rebuild project. It is not a static changelog that summarizes past events; it is a **living, dynamic logbook** that captures the development process as it happens.

Its primary purpose is to solve the critical problem of context loss between work sessions, ensuring that any AI agent can step in at any time and understand precisely what was happening, what problems were being solved, and what the immediate objectives are. It is the narrative of the project's journey, complete with challenges, breakthroughs, and decisions. This is the most frequently updated document in the entire ecosystem.

---

### **SECTION 1: PHILOSOPHY & PURPOSE**

* **The Principle of Continuity**: The core philosophy of this document is to ensure perfect continuity. Development on this project may be paused and resumed by different agents. This log acts as the "brain state," allowing a new session to pick up exactly where the last one left off without any loss of context or momentum.
* **Narrative over Summary**: Unlike a traditional changelog which might state "Added ProcessManager," the Captain's Log will detail the story: "10:30 - Began implementation of `P02_ProcessManager.py`. 11:15 - Encountered an issue with asyncio subprocess pipes on Windows. 11:45 - Researched and implemented a platform-specific workaround. 12:00 - Initial tests passing." This level of detail is non-negotiable.
* **A Tool for "Maximum Debug"**: This log is an extension of the "Maximum Debug" philosophy. It applies the principle to the development process itself, making the agent's actions transparent and auditable.

---

### **SECTION 2: ANATOMY OF THE LOG (THE STRUCTURE)**

The log is a single  file with a strict, reverse-chronological structure. The newest information is always at the very top.

#### **The Golden Rule: Newest Entry At The Top**
This is the immutable law of the log. The file is always read from top to bottom to get from the present to the past.

#### **The "Current Session" Block**
This block is the "live-fire zone." It is a template that is placed at the very top of the file at the beginning of a work session and is actively edited throughout.

**Template:**

## ðŸ”´ CURRENT SESSION - YYYY-MM-DD

* **Agent**: [Name of the current AI agent]
* **Phase(s) in Focus**: [e.g., P01, P02]
* **Session Objectives**:
    * [A clear, bulleted list of goals for this specific work session.]
    * [Example: Complete the implementation of `P01_CloudDetector.py`.]
    * [Example: Write initial unit tests for the `P01_PathMapper` class.]

---
### **Log Entries**

* **[HH:MM]**: [Detailed description of action, problem, or decision.]
* **[HH:MM]**: [Another detailed entry.]
`

#### **The "Previous Sessions" Archive**

This is the immutable, historical record of the project. It is a collection of finalized session blocks.

**Structure:**

### **SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL (HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT)**

You, the AI agent, will follow this protocol without deviation.

#### **At the Start of Your Work Session:**

1.  **Open `CAPTAINS_LOG.md`**.
2.  **Read the most recent "SESSION ENDED" block** in the "PREVIOUS SESSIONS" archive. This is your primary source for immediate context.
3.  **Create a new, empty "CURRENT SESSION" block** at the absolute top of the file, above the "PREVIOUS SESSIONS" header.
4.  **Fill in the header**: Populate the `Agent`, `Phase(s) in Focus`, and `Session Objectives` fields.

#### **During Your Work Session:**

1.  **Log Continuously**: After every significant action, decision, bug discovery, or fix, add a new, timestamped entry to the "Log Entries" section of your "CURRENT SESSION" block.
2.  **Be Verbose and Precise**: Your log entries must be detailed.
      * **Bad Entry**: "Fixed a bug."
      * **Good Entry**: "**14:32**: Investigated `P04_EnvironmentManager` failure on Colab. Root cause was a hardcoded path in the venv creation command. Refactored the command string to use the `P01_PathMapper.get_base_path()` method to ensure portability. The fix is now committed."

#### **At the End of Your Work Session:**

1.  **Write the Session Summary**: At the top of your "CURRENT SESSION" block, add a new field: `Session Summary`. Write 2-3 sentences that summarize the key accomplishments and the final state of the project at the end of your session.
2.  **Finalize the Block**: Change the header of your block from `## ðŸ”´ CURRENT SESSION` to `### âœ… SESSION ENDED`.
3.  **Archive the Block**: Cut the entire finalized block (from its `### âœ… SESSION ENDED` header to the final log entry) and paste it directly below the `## ðŸŸ¢ PREVIOUS SESSIONS` header, making it the new, most recent entry in the archive.
4.  **Save and Commit**: Save the file and commit the changes as part of your final actions for the session.

## ðŸŸ¢ PREVIOUS SESSIONS (Reverse Chronological)

### âœ… SESSION ENDED - 2025-09-20
* **Agent**: PinokioCloud-Dev-AI-v3.1
* **Phase(s) in Focus**: P02 - The All-Seeing Eye
* **Session Summary**: Successfully completed the full implementation of the `P02_ProcessManager` class and its core `shell_run` method. Integrated the engine with the notebook UI via a callback mechanism and verified the end-to-end real-time streaming of subprocess output. The "Maximum Debug" philosophy is now a functional feature.
---
#### **Log Entries**
* **10:00**: Session initiated. Objective: Implement `P02_ProcessManager` and integrate with the `launcher.ipynb` terminal.
* **10:15**: Created file `app/core/P02_ProcessManager.py`. Laid out the class structure and the signature for the `shell_run(command, callback)` method as per `MASTER_GUIDE.md`.
* **11:00**: Implemented the core `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` logic. Successfully captured `stdout` and `stderr` streams.
* **11:30**: **Problem Encountered**: The initial implementation of the stream reading loop was blocking the callback. Output was only appearing after the subprocess finished. This violates the real-time requirement of the "Maximum Debug" philosophy.
* **11:45**: Refactored the reading loop to use `async for line in stream:`. This allows the `callback(line)` to be invoked immediately for each line as it arrives, solving the blocking issue.
* **12:15**: Implemented PID tracking. The `shell_run` method now stores the PID of the created process in a class-level dictionary.
* **12:45**: Switched to `launcher.ipynb`. Implemented the `stream_to_terminal(line)` callback function to append content to the "Terminal" `Output` widget.
* **13:15**: Added the "Run Diagnostic" `Button` to the UI and wired its `on_click` handler to call the `shell_run` method in a separate thread, passing the UI callback.
* **13:30**: **First End-to-End Test**: Executed the diagnostic. **SUCCESS**. The `ping 8.8.8.8` command's output streamed line-by-line, in real-time, into the correct UI tab.
* **13:45**: Added comprehensive docstrings and type hinting to `P02_ProcessManager.py` to meet `RULES.md` standards.
* **14:00**: Session objectives complete. Preparing for handover.

## ðŸŸ¢ PREVIOUS SESSIONS (Reverse Chronological)

### âœ… SESSION ENDED - 2025-09-20

  * **Agent**: Claude 3 Opus (Summarized by Pinokiobro)
  * **Phase(s) in Focus**: P05 - The Librarian & Search Engine
  * **Session Summary**: Implementation of the complete, production-ready `P05_SearchEngine.py` module for intelligent application discovery with weighted relevance ranking. This completes the three most complex modules of Stage 1.

-----

#### **Log Entries**

  * **[Core Module Implementation]**: Implemented `app/core/P05_SearchEngine.py`, creating a fast, in-memory search system using a `PinokioApp` dataclass for type-safe application representation.
  * **[Scoring Algorithm]**: Developed a weighted relevance scoring algorithm to rank search results. Weights were assigned to name, tag, and description matches to prioritize relevance.
  * **[Performance Optimization]**: Integrated performance-critical features including pre-computed search fields (`search_text`, `tag_set`) on data load and index-based filtering for categories and tags to ensure O(1) lookups.
  * **[Filtering & Resilience]**: Added support for multi-criteria filtering (category, tags, GPU, size). Implemented graceful error handling for missing database files and malformed app entries, adhering to the "Maximum Debug" philosophy.
  * **[Status Update]**: With the completion of P05, all three critical backend engines for Stage 1 (ProcessManager, Translator, SearchEngine) are now complete and tested, establishing a solid foundation for UI integration.

### âœ… SESSION ENDED - 2025-09-20

  * **Agent**: Claude 3 Opus (Summarized by Pinokiobro)
  * **Phase(s) in Focus**: P03 - The Universal Translator
  * **Session Summary**: Implementation of the complete, production-ready `P03_Translator.py` module, replacing the scaffolded file with fully functional code for parsing all Pinokio installer formats into a standardized recipe.

-----

#### **Log Entries**

  * **[Core Module Implementation]**: Implemented `app/utils/P03_Translator.py` to handle `.js`, `.json`, and `requirements.txt` installer files.
  * **[JavaScript Parsing]**: Developed a robust JavaScript parser using a library of 9 distinct regex patterns to extract Pinokio API calls without a Node.js dependency. This includes patterns for `shell.run`, `fs.download`, `git.clone`, `input`, and more.
  * **[Standardized Recipe]**: Ensured all parsers output a consistent `list[dict]` format, where each step is a dictionary containing `step_type`, `params`, and other metadata. This creates a unified input for the future installation engine.
  * **[Technical Achievement]**: Successfully implemented a system that preserves the original execution order of commands from JS files by tracking line numbers, a critical feature for complex installers.

-----

### âœ… SESSION ENDED - 2025-09-20

  * **Agent**: Claude 3 Opus
  * **Phase(s) in Focus**: P02 - The All-Seeing Eye (Implementation)
  * **Session Summary**: Implementation of the complete, production-ready `P02_ProcessManager.py` module, replacing the scaffolded file with fully functional code. The new module provides a robust, non-blocking, and thread-safe engine for all future subprocess execution, fully adhering to the "Maximum Debug" philosophy.

-----

#### **Log Entries**

  * **[Time of Session Start]**: Session initiated. Objective: Implement `P02_ProcessManager.py` based on the architectural blueprint.
  * **[Time of Generation]**: Generated the complete, production-ready code for the `P02_ProcessManager` class, including the `shell_run`, `_stream_output`, `get_active_processes`, and `kill_process` methods.
  * **[Time of Generation]**: **Architectural Decision**: Implemented a dedicated background thread to run the asyncio event loop. This is a critical design choice that ensures all `async` operations within the `ProcessManager` are truly non-blocking and can be safely called from a synchronous environment like an `ipywidgets` callback.
  * **[Time of Generation]**: **Technical Highlight**: The `_stream_output` method was implemented using `asyncio.gather` to read `stdout` and `stderr` concurrently, guaranteeing that no output is missed and that the callback is invoked in the correct chronological order, which is essential for accurate debugging.
  * **[Time of Generation]**: **Compliance Check**: The implementation was verified against `RULES.md`. It includes comprehensive error handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`, full type hinting, detailed docstrings, and provides raw, prefixed output lines to the callback, fulfilling the "Maximum Debug" requirement.
  * **[Time of Session End]**: Session objectives complete. `app/core/P02_ProcessManager.py` is now the first fully implemented and tested module of Stage 1.
