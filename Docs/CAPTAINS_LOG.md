# CAPTAINS_LOG.md - The Live Handover & Changelog

## **PREAMBLE: THE PROJECT'S MEMORY**

This document is the single source of truth for the **momentum, context, and history** of the PinokioCloud Rebuild project. It is not a static changelog that summarizes past events; it is a **living, dynamic logbook** that captures the development process as it happens.

Its primary purpose is to solve the critical problem of context loss between work sessions, ensuring that any AI agent can step in at any time and understand precisely what was happening, what problems were being solved, and what the immediate objectives are. It is the narrative of the project's journey, complete with challenges, breakthroughs, and decisions. This is the most frequently updated document in the entire ecosystem.

---

### **SECTION 1: PHILOSOPHY & PURPOSE**

* **The Principle of Continuity**: The core philosophy of this document is to ensure perfect continuity. Development on this project may be paused and resumed by different agents. This log acts as the "brain state," allowing a new session to pick up exactly where the last one left off without any loss of context or momentum.
* **Narrative over Summary**: Unlike a traditional changelog which might state "Added ProcessManager," the Captain's Log will detail the story: "10:30 - Began implementation of `P02_ProcessManager.py`. 11:15 - Encountered an issue with asyncio subprocess pipes on Windows. 11:45 - Researched and implemented a platform-specific workaround. 12:00 - Initial tests passing." This level of detail is non-negotiable.
* **A Tool for "Maximum Debug"**: This log is an extension of the "Maximum Debug" philosophy. It applies the principle to the development process itself, making the agent's actions transparent and auditable.

---

### **SECTION 2: ANATOMY OF THE LOG (THE STRUCTURE)**

The log is a single  file with a strict, reverse-chronological structure. The newest information is always at the very top.

#### **The Golden Rule: Newest Entry At The Top**
This is the immutable law of the log. The file is always read from top to bottom to get from the present to the past.

#### **The "Current Session" Block**
This block is the "live-fire zone." It is a template that is placed at the very top of the file at the beginning of a work session and is actively edited throughout.

**Template:**

### **SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL (HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT)**

You, the AI agent, will follow this protocol without deviation.

#### **At the Start of Your Work Session:**

1.  **Open `CAPTAINS_LOG.md`**.
2.  **Read the most recent "SESSION ENDED" block** in the "PREVIOUS SESSIONS" archive. This is your primary source for immediate context.
3.  **Create a new, empty "CURRENT SESSION" block** at the absolute top of the file, above the "PREVIOUS SESSIONS" header.
4.  **Fill in the header**: Populate the `Agent`, `Phase(s) in Focus`, and `Session Objectives` fields.

#### **During Your Work Session:**

1.  **Log Continuously**: After every significant action, decision, bug discovery, or fix, add a new, timestamped entry to the "Log Entries" section of your "CURRENT SESSION" block.
2.  **Be Verbose and Precise**: Your log entries must be detailed.
      * **Bad Entry**: "Fixed a bug."
      * **Good Entry**: "**14:32**: Investigated `P04_EnvironmentManager` failure on Colab. Root cause was a hardcoded path in the venv creation command. Refactored the command string to use the `P01_PathMapper.get_base_path()` method to ensure portability. The fix is now committed."

#### **At the End of Your Work Session:**

1.  **Write the Session Summary**: At the top of your "CURRENT SESSION" block, add a new field: `Session Summary`. Write 2-3 sentences that summarize the key accomplishments and the final state of the project at the end of your session.
2.  **Finalize the Block**: Change the header of your block from `## ðŸ”´ CURRENT SESSION` to `### âœ… SESSION ENDED`.
3.  **Archive the Block**: Cut the entire finalized block (from its `### âœ… SESSION ENDED` header to the final log entry) and paste it directly below the `## ðŸŸ¢ PREVIOUS SESSIONS` header, making it the new, most recent entry in the archive.
4.  **Save and Commit**: Save the file and commit the changes as part of your final actions for the session.

* **Agent**: PinokioCloud-Dev-AI-v3.1
* **Phase(s) in Focus**: P02 - The All-Seeing Eye
* **Session Summary**: Successfully completed the full implementation of the `P02_ProcessManager` class and its core `shell_run` method. Integrated the engine with the notebook UI via a callback mechanism and verified the end-to-end real-time streaming of subprocess output. The "Maximum Debug" philosophy is now a functional feature.
---
#### **Log Entries**
* **10:00**: Session initiated. Objective: Implement `P02_ProcessManager` and integrate with the `launcher.ipynb` terminal.
* **10:15**: Created file `app/core/P02_ProcessManager.py`. Laid out the class structure and the signature for the `shell_run(command, callback)` method as per `MASTER_GUIDE.md`.
* **11:00**: Implemented the core `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` logic. Successfully captured `stdout` and `stderr` streams.
* **11:30**: **Problem Encountered**: The initial implementation of the stream reading loop was blocking the callback. Output was only appearing after the subprocess finished. This violates the real-time requirement of the "Maximum Debug" philosophy.
* **11:45**: Refactored the reading loop to use `async for line in stream:`. This allows the `callback(line)` to be invoked immediately for each line as it arrives, solving the blocking issue.
* **12:15**: Implemented PID tracking. The `shell_run` method now stores the PID of the created process in a class-level dictionary.
* **12:45**: Switched to `launcher.ipynb`. Implemented the `stream_to_terminal(line)` callback function to append content to the "Terminal" `Output` widget.
* **13:15**: Added the "Run Diagnostic" `Button` to the UI and wired its `on_click` handler to call the `shell_run` method in a separate thread, passing the UI callback.
* **13:30**: **First End-to-End Test**: Executed the diagnostic. **SUCCESS**. The `ping 8.8.8.8` command's output streamed line-by-line, in real-time, into the correct UI tab.
* **13:45**: Added comprehensive docstrings and type hinting to `P02_ProcessManager.py` to meet `RULES.md` standards.
* **14:00**: Session objectives complete. Preparing for handover.
