Acknowledged. Here is the blank, reusable template for a **"Feature Enhancement Directive."**

This template is architected to translate our strategic plans into precise, actionable, and verifiable instructions for the Builder AI.

# **FEATURE ENHANCEMENT DIRECTIVE**

## **1. CONTEXT & STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE**

*   **Target Module(s)**: `[Specify the full path to the primary file(s) being enhanced]`
*   **Enhancement Phase**: `[e.g., P19 - User Experience Polish]`
*   **Strategic Justification**: `[Explain the high-level goal of this enhancement, citing the research document that provides the mandate (e.g., "To implement the professional, responsive GridBox layout as detailed in the JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_OPTIMIZATION.md").]`
*   **Architectural Impact**: `[Describe how this change will improve the system's architecture (e.g., "This will refactor the UI from a basic Tab widget into a more modular and visually appealing GridBox, improving user experience and code maintainability.").]`
