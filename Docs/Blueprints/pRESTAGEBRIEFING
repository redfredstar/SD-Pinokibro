**[Architect's Pre-Stage Briefing for Stage [Stage Number]: [Stage Name]]**

**TO**: PinokioCloud Builder AI
**FROM**: PinokioCloud Architect
**SUBJECT**: Directive for Commencing Stage [Stage Number] Development

**1. Mission Context & Criticality Assessment:**
[A detailed synthesis of the stage's importance, objectives, and criticality tier based on all project documents will be dynamically generated here.]

**2. Overarching Objective:**
[A clear, concise statement of the main goal for the stage will be dynamically generated here.]

**3. Architectural Strategy & Key Challenges:**
[A breakdown of the mandatory architectural patterns, workflow, and the highest-risk technical challenges for the stage will be dynamically generated here.]

**4. Special Treatment Protocols in Effect:**
[A list of the specific high-level rules or special protocols (e.g., "Concurrency Safety," "Comprehensive State Management") that are paramount for this stage will be generated here.]

### **Your Task: Analysis and Strategic Acknowledgment**

This is a **strategy and planning step**. You will not write any application code at this time.

Your sole task is to analyze the briefing I have provided and respond with your own **"Builder's Strategic Acknowledgment."** This response must contain the following three sections:

**1. Acknowledgment of Core Objective:**
*   A brief, one-sentence confirmation that you understand the primary goal of this stage.

**2. Identification of Primary Risks:**
*   Based on my briefing and your understanding of the project, list the top 2-3 risks or potential failure points you foresee during this stage. (e.g., "Risk 1: Race conditions between UI updates and the new job queue," or "Risk 2: The `P14_WebUIDetector`'s regex library failing to match an uncommon server startup message.")

**3. Proposed Points of Focus:**
*   List 2-3 specific, actionable "Points of Focus" you will prioritize during implementation to mitigate the risks you identified. (e.g., "Focus 1: I will ensure the worker thread's `try/except` block is comprehensive enough to catch any exception from any engine call," or "Focus 2: I will prioritize robust error handling and timeouts in the `P17` health check to prevent the system from hanging on an unresponsive app.")

After you provide your Strategic Acknowledgment, you will **STOP** and await my final "Plan Approved" confirmation. We will only proceed to the implementation phase after this strategic handshake is complete.
