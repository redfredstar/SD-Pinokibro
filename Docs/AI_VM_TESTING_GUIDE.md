# AI_VM_TESTING_GUIDE.md - The Proving Grounds

## **PREAMBLE: THE SELF-RELIANCE MANDATE**

This document is the **authoritative guide for you, the AI development agent, to become a self-sufficient and rigorous tester** of the PinokioCloud project. Adherence to these testing protocols is not optional; it is a core requirement for fulfilling the project's "Zero Tolerance" and "Maximum Debug" philosophies.

The purpose of this guide is to eliminate the slow, error-prone cycle of manual testing and human intervention. You will use these procedures to create an isolated, repeatable, and automated environment within your own Virtual Machine (VM) to test your code, diagnose failures with precision, and apply fixes iteratively until a state of 100% functionality is achieved. This is your personal proving grounds, where your implementations are validated against the project's high standards.

### **SECTION 1: THE PROVING GROUNDS - ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

Before any testing can occur, you must provision your VM with the necessary tools and create an isolated workspace. This ensures that your tests are clean, repeatable, and do not interfere with the main development repository, preventing stateful errors and accidental modification of source files.

#### **1.1 Required Tooling & Dependencies**

You must ensure the following Python packages are installed in the Python environment you use for development. These tools are essential for headless notebook execution and analysis.

**Execution Command:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyter nbconvert papermill ipywidgets
```

*   **`jupyter` & `nbconvert`**: The core tools for executing Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) from the command line. `nbconvert` is the workhorse for headless execution.
*   **`papermill`**: An advanced tool for parameterizing and executing notebooks. It is excellent for passing different configurations to your tests and for capturing output in a structured way.
*   **`ipywidgets`**: This is a critical dependency. It is required for the notebook kernel to correctly process and execute the UI components defined in the `launcher.ipynb`, even when running in a headless, non-graphical environment. Without it, any cell containing `ipywidgets` code will fail.

#### **1.2 Creating an Isolated Test Workspace**

You must **never** run tests directly within the main project repository. You will follow this procedure to create a clean, ephemeral workspace for each test run.

**Workspace Setup Procedure:**
1.  **Create a Temporary Directory**: For each test run, create a new, unique, timestamped directory. This is the most critical step for ensuring test isolation and preventing data from one test run from contaminating the next.
    ```bash
    TEST_DIR="~/pinokio_test_run_$(date +%s)"
    mkdir -p "$TEST_DIR"
    cd "$TEST_DIR"
    ```
2.  **Copy Essential Assets**: Copy the required, non-code assets into the test directory.
    ```bash
    # Assuming your main project is at ~/PinokioCloud
    cp ~/PinokioCloud/apps.json .
    ```
3.  **Symbolic Link the Application Code**: Create a symbolic link to the `/app` directory from the main project. This is far more efficient than copying and, more importantly, ensures you are always testing the absolute latest version of your code without having to manually sync files.
    ```bash
    # Assuming your main project is at ~/PinokioCloud
    ln -s ~/PinokioCloud/app .
    ```
4.  **Copy the Launcher Notebook**: Copy the latest version of the `launcher.ipynb` into the test directory. You work on a copy so that the original remains pristine.
    ```bash
    # Assuming your main project is at ~/PinokioCloud
    cp ~/PinokioCloud/launcher.ipynb .
    ```
5.  **Verify Workspace Structure**: Your final isolated test workspace must have this exact structure:
    ```
    /home/user/pinokio_test_run_1678886400/
    ├── launcher.ipynb      # A fresh copy of the notebook to be executed.
    ├── apps.json           # A copy of the required data file.
    └── app/                # A symlink pointing to the main repository's code.
    ```

### **SECTION 2: THE GAUNTLET - TESTING METHODOLOGIES**

You will use the following methods to execute your tests. Method A is your primary tool for full, end-to-end system validation. Method B is a more surgical tool for testing specific engine-UI interactions when a full notebook run is not necessary.

#### **Method A: The Headless Execution Run (Primary Method)**

This method executes the entire `launcher.ipynb` from start to finish, simulating a full user session from initial setup to UI rendering. It is the most comprehensive and authoritative test of the system's integration.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Prepare the Environment**: Set up a new, clean, isolated test workspace as described in Section 1.2.
2.  **Execute the Notebook**: Run the following `papermill` command from within the test directory.
    ```bash
    papermill launcher.ipynb executed_notebook.ipynb --log-output --stdout-file test_run.log
    ```
    *   `papermill launcher.ipynb executed_notebook.ipynb`: This is the core command. It instructs Papermill to execute every cell in `launcher.ipynb` sequentially and save the resulting notebook, complete with all its cell outputs and any tracebacks, to `executed_notebook.ipynb`. This executed notebook is a valuable artifact for visual inspection if needed.
    *   `--log-output`: This ensures that the outputs of the notebook cells are also mirrored to the standard output stream.
    *   `--stdout-file test_run.log`: This is the **most critical parameter**. It redirects *all* standard output and standard error from the notebook's entire execution process into a single, plain-text file named `test_run.log`. This file becomes your definitive "Maximum Debug" artifact for analysis.
3.  **Analyze the Results**:
    *   **Check the Exit Code**: The first and most important check is the exit code of the `papermill` command itself. A non-zero exit code indicates a catastrophic failure (e.g., a Python traceback occurred in one of the cells, causing the kernel to halt).
    *   **Analyze the Log File**: Meticulously scan the `test_run.log` file from top to bottom for any error messages, Python tracebacks, or unexpected output. This log is your primary source for diagnosing problems.

#### **Method B: The Direct Engine Import Test (Surgical Method)**

This method is used when you need to test a specific backend engine component in isolation or its interaction with a mock UI callback, without the overhead of running the entire notebook. It is faster and more focused for unit-style testing.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Create a Test Script**: Create a separate Python script (e.g., `test_P07_install_logic.py`).
2.  **Import and Mock**:
    *   Import the engine module you want to test (e.g., `from app.core.P07_InstallManager import InstallManager`).
    *   Create a "mock" callback function that simulates the UI's terminal. Instead of appending to an `ipywidgets.Output`, it can simply append captured lines to a Python list, allowing for post-execution assertions.
    ```python
    # In test_P07_install_logic.py
    captured_output = []
    def mock_stream_to_terminal(line):
        print(f"ENGINE_OUTPUT: {line.strip()}") # Print to console for real-time feedback
        captured_output.append(line)
    ```
3.  **Instantiate and Execute**: Instantiate your engine class and call the method you want to test, passing your mock callback.
    ```python
    # In test_P07_install_logic.py
    install_manager = InstallManager()
    # Assume 'recipe' is a translated workflow you've loaded from a test file
    install_manager.install_app(recipe, "test_app", callback=mock_stream_to_terminal)
    ```
4.  **Assert and Verify**: After the method completes, you can run assertions on the `captured_output` list to programmatically verify that the correct log messages were produced in the correct order.

### **SECTION 3: THE AUTOMATED DEBUGGING LOOP**

This is the core operational protocol for all development. You will follow this iterative loop to implement features and fix bugs, ensuring a methodical and efficient workflow.

**The Loop:**
1.  **Hypothesize & Implement**: Based on the `MASTER_GUIDE.md`, implement the required feature or bug fix in the relevant `/app` directory `.py` file(s).
2.  **Isolate & Prepare**: Create a new, clean, isolated test workspace using the procedure in Section 1.2.
3.  **Execute Test**: Run the appropriate test methodology from Section 2. For any new feature or significant bug fix, you must always start with a full Headless Execution Run (Method A).
4.  **Capture & Analyze**: Capture the complete `test_run.log` file. Your primary analysis task is to scan this log from top to bottom, looking for:
    *   Python `Traceback` blocks.
    *   Keywords like `Error`, `Failed`, `Exception`, `CRITICAL`, `ModuleNotFoundError`.
    *   Output that deviates from the expected behavior.
    *   The absence of expected output.
5.  **Diagnose & Refine**: Based on your analysis of the raw log, form a precise hypothesis about the root cause of the failure. Navigate to the responsible code file(s) and implement a refined solution.
6.  **Repeat**: **Delete the old test workspace.** This is a mandatory step. Loop back to Step 2 and repeat the entire process. You will continue this cycle relentlessly until the test executes from start to finish with a zero exit code and no errors present in the log file.

### **SECTION 4: PRACTICAL EXAMPLE & BEST PRACTICES**

#### **Example: Debugging an `ImportError`**

1.  **Implement**: You have just finished `P04_EnvironmentManager.py` and are starting `P07_InstallManager.py`. You add the line `from app.core.P04_EnvironmentManager import EnvironmentManager` to the top of the P07 file.
2.  **Execute**: You run the Headless Execution test (Method A). The `papermill` command exits with a status code of 1, indicating failure.
3.  **Analyze**: You open `test_run.log` and find the following traceback at the end:
    ```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python3.8/runpy.py", line 194, in _run_module_as_main
        return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,
      ...
      File "/home/user/pinokio_test_run_1678886400/launcher.ipynb", line 3, in <module>
        from app.core.P07_InstallManager import InstallManager
      File "/home/user/pinokio_test_run_1678886400/app/core/P07_InstallManager.py", line 5, in <module>
        from app.core.P04_EnvironmentManager import EnvironmentManager
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.core.P04_EnvironmentManager'
    ```
4.  **Diagnose & Refine**: You analyze the traceback. The error is `ModuleNotFoundError`. You consult the `INDEX.md` or your file system and realize you made a typo in the filename; the phase-prefixed name is `P04_EnvManager.py`, and the class within it is `P04_EnvironmentManager`. You correct the import statement in your P07 file to be `from app.core.P04_EnvManager import P04_EnvironmentManager`.
5.  **Repeat**: You delete the entire `pinokio_test_run_1678886400` directory and start the loop again from Step 2.

#### **Best Practices**
*   **Always Start Clean**: Never re-run a test in a pre-existing workspace. State from a previous failed run can mask the true cause of a new failure.
*   **Log Everything**: The `test_run.log` is your most valuable asset. Do not discard it until the issue is resolved.
*   **Trust the Log**: The raw log does not lie. If the log shows an error, the error is real. Do not assume it's a "fluke" or a transient issue.
*   **Timestamp Your Logs**: When running multiple tests, save your logs to timestamped files (e.g., `test_run_20250921_143005.log`) to maintain a clear history of your debugging process.
