# PinokioCloud - Cloud-Native Application Management System

## Overview

PinokioCloud is a comprehensive cloud-native rebuild of the Pinokio application management system, designed specifically for Jupyter Notebook environments using ipywidgets for the user interface.

## Key Features

- **🔧 Complete Application Lifecycle Management**: From discovery to installation to launch and management
- **🌐 WebUI Detection & Tunneling**: Automatic detection of web interfaces with public URL creation
- **📦 Environment Isolation**: Conda-first environment management with automatic fallback strategies
- **🔄 Real-time Process Management**: Non-blocking process execution with live output streaming
- **🛡️ Maximum Debug Philosophy**: Complete transparency with full traceback reporting
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive validation walkthroughs and architectural documentation

## Architecture

The system is built around 14 core engine managers organized in a modular architecture:

### Core Engines
- **P02_ProcessManager**: Real-time process execution and monitoring
- **P04_EnvironmentManager**: Conda/Venv environment management
- **P05_SearchEngine**: Application discovery and search
- **P07_InstallManager**: Universal installer execution
- **P08_StateManager**: Atomic state management and persistence
- **P11_LibraryManager**: Application library management
- **P13_LaunchManager**: Application launch orchestration
- **P14_TunnelManager**: Public tunnel creation via ngrok

### Utility Engines
- **P01_CloudDetector**: Platform detection and adaptation
- **P01_PathMapper**: Path resolution and mapping
- **P03_Translator**: Universal installer translation
- **P05_AppAnalyzer**: Application analysis and validation
- **P14_WebUIDetector**: WebUI pattern detection and URL extraction
