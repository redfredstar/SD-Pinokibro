P02_ProcessManager.py - The All-Seeing Eye (Real-Time Monitoring Engine)

This module implements the "Maximum Debug" philosophy by providing real-time, unfiltered
shell command execution with live output streaming. It captures all stdout/stderr and
streams it to callback functions for transparent process monitoring.
