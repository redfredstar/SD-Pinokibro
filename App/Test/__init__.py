"""
PinokioCloud Test Suite Package

This package contains comprehensive test suites for the PinokioCloud rebuild project.
All test files follow the naming convention PXX-Test_ModuleName.py and provide:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Mock implementations for isolated testing
- Test utilities and fixtures

Tests are designed to validate the "Maximum Debug" philosophy and ensure
all components work correctly in isolation and together.
