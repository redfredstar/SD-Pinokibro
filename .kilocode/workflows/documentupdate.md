This workflow outlines the "End-of-Stage Audit Protocol" for all documentation. It is a mandatory procedure performed at the conclusion of the final development phase of each stage (e.g., P06, P12, P18, P20). Its purpose is to ensure the entire project's documentation is clean, professional, and perfectly synchronized with the completed codebase before a new stage begins.

## Steps

1.  **Initiate the Audit Phase**: This workflow begins after the final development phase of a stage is complete. The first step is to perform all required code quality checks, including linting and a comprehensive review against the `MASTER_GUIDE.md`.

2.  **Update `CAPTAINS_LOG.md`**: Write a detailed summary of the entire stage's accomplishments, challenges faced, and the solutions that were implemented.

3.  **Update Core Documents**: Review, update, and create the documents specified for the particular audit phase in the `MASTER_GUIDE.md`. For example, the Stage 1 Audit (P06) requires creating `PINOKIO_SCROLLS.md`, while the Stage 4 Audit (P20) requires creating the final handover documents like `User_Guide.md` and `Developer_Guide.md`.

4.  **Update `INDEX.md`**: Meticulously update the "Script & File Index" within `INDEX.md`. You must add detailed entries for every single new file that was created during the stage. This is a mandatory protocol for maintaining the project's master map.
