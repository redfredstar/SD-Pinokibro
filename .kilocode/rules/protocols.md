## Guidelines - Operational Protocols

-   **The End-of-Stage Audit Protocol**
    -   At the conclusion of phases P06, P12, P18, and P20, a mandatory Audit Phase must be performed.
    -   The audit includes: linting, comprehensive review against `MASTER_GUIDE.md` and `RULES.md`, completing the Stage Validation Checklist, and updating `CAPTAINS_LOG.md` and `INDEX.md`.

-   **The `CAPTAINS_LOG.md` Update Protocol**
    -   The log must be updated continuously throughout a work session.
    -   A "CURRENT SESSION" block is created at the start and finalized/archived at the end of the session.

-   **The `INDEX.md` Update Protocol**
    -   The `INDEX.md` file will only be updated during an official End-of-Stage Audit phase.

-   **Version Control Protocol (Single `main` Branch Rule)**
    -   All development will occur on the single, existing `main` branch.
    -   Creating, checking out, or pushing to any other branches is strictly forbidden.
