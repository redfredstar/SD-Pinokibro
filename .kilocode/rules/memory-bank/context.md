# ## Current Context

# **Last Updated**: 2025-10-01

# ---

# ### Current State
# *   The project is **FEATURE COMPLETE**. All 22 development phases, including the critical P19 Centralized UI Orchestrator, have been fully implemented and verified.
# *   The system is now in a final enhancement phase, designated the **"Phoenix Refactor,"** which aims to integrate high-value research findings into the completed `launcher.ipynb`.

# ### Recent Changes & Achievements
# *   **P19 UI Orchestrator Implemented**: The `launcher.ipynb` now contains a concurrent-safe job queue and persistent worker thread, solving the primary architectural risk of race conditions.
# *   **Full Project Audit**: A comprehensive audit of all code and documentation was completed, purging all placeholders and ensuring 100% compliance with project laws.
# *   **Memory Bank Initialized**: The persistent memory system for the Builder AI has been successfully initialized. This `context.md` file is the first corrective action to ensure its accuracy.

# ### Next Steps
# *   The immediate next step is to execute the "Phoenix Refactor" on the `launcher_v2.ipynb`.
# *   This refactor will focus on implementing the professional `GridBox` UI layout and platform-aware optimizations for Colab and Lightning.ai, as detailed in the project's research documents.
